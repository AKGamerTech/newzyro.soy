# [A Nightmare With Colors: Resaturated](https://akgamertech.github.io/ANWC-Resaturated/index.html)

Hello, this website was made by me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of the website is to start a portfolio of websites I made, also this is the V2 of the website *POG* to see the trash that was the first one [click here.](https://akgamertech.github.io/ANWC-Website-Old/index.html)

All stuff ANWC related is made by @newzyro_

Website made using a bit of my brain and ChatGPT

Original concept of FNAF is made by Scott Cawthon and ANWC is a inspiration of it

STORY:
======

> You have recently been running low on money. So your first decision was to get a quick job at the new restaurant that popped up recently.

> It's called "The ColorFun Diner", it features a full cast of animatronic characters as its main attraction, something popularized by recent horror video game franchises.

> Now, working at The Colorfun Diner, you must complete missions, survive the nightshift and fight traumas, all in the timespan of one night.

GAMEPLAY:
=========

> The game is divided in small gameplay levels, those can be one off gameplay styles or could be more 'traditional' FNaF gameplay type night shifts.

> Currently, the demo contains 6(?) gameplay sections, those being 3 One Off Gameplay Levels and 3 NightShift Levels. The demo takes around 40 minutes to complete.
